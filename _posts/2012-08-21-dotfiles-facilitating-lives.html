    <h2>Dotfiles - Facilitating our lives</h2>
    <h4>I have seen that more and more people are adopting the practice of saving its personal settings for desktop Linux environment in the GitHub repository. I am one of those people, and I ended up using this practice to create my own 'dotfiles'.</h4>

    <p>In this matter, people who works in many different environments have the facility to centralize all its settings in just one place. Is this good practice, or what?</p>

    <h4>Here are some examples:</h4>

    <p><a href="https://github.com/lucashungaro/dotfiles" target="_blank"> https://github.com/lucashungaro/dotfiles</a></p>

    <p>In my opinion, this method turns the task of setting up my work environment in a new machine, a lot easier and faster. It is cool isn't ?</p>

    <p>Itâ€™s my tip.</p>
